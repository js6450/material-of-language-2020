# #coronavirus: a visual poetry

[See the project live!](https://tweet-py.herokuapp.com/) You may have to wait a couple of seconds to see the tweet visualizations to appear.


## Technical Details

This project uses [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) to stream recent tweets filtered by #coronavirus and uses [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html) for sentiment analysis to generate the visualizations of the tweets. 3 to 4 tweets are displayed at a given time, and new tweets are continuously retrieved for new visualizations.

The size of the text and the amount of sideways movement depend on how subjective the tweet is. Tweets with positive sentiments travel towards the top, and those with negative sentiments move towards the bottom. If sentiment of a tweet is very negative (score of less than -0.5) then there is added noise to the generated visualization, making the tweets less readable.

The server is written in python with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and uses [socket.io](https://socket.io/) to pass on data (points of the font data for text, raw tweet text, sentiment analysis score) to the web client. Text visualizations are generated by extracting points of font data of the text of the tweets using [Bezmerizing](https://github.com/aparrish/bezmerizing).
